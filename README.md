# Toolshed
Toolshed is a Laravel Homestead web app I created to manage hydroponic crops. 

Todo:
- Debug code after checking out updates
- Run php artisan make:auth to generate views and authentication endpoints for user management
- Reference the auth part of this page to finish setting up user management: https://laravel.com/docs/5.1/quickstart-intermediate. Source code examples are also here: https://github.com/laravel/quickstart-intermediate
- Test the CRUD operations of each controller now they can verify user owns the object they're trying to update. 
- Remove verifyInstanceOwner function in any models/controllers
