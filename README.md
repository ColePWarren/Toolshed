# Toolshed
Toolshed is a Laravel Homestead web app I created to manage hydroponic crops. 

Todo:
- Debug code after checking out updates
- Run php artisan make:auth to generate views and authentication endpoints for user management
- Test the CRUD operations of each controller now they can verify user owns the object they're trying to update. 
- Make verifyInstanceOwner it's own helper function
